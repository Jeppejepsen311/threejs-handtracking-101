## Introduction

In recent years, hand tracking has gained popularity, especially in gaming and virtual reality. This project aims to make it accessible for developers and enthusiasts alike. By combining Three.js and MediaPipe, you can create engaging applications that respond to user gestures in real-time.

## Features

- Control a 3D sphere with hand gestures.
- Responsive and smooth animations.
- Open-source and free to use.
- Detailed tutorial for easy implementation.
- Cross-browser compatibility.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several powerful technologies:

- **Three.js**: A popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **WebGL**: A JavaScript API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework by Google for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.
